# Instructions

The `plumber` stack has been designed to host multiple APIs at `api.example.com`. This is done by:

1. Developing a plumber API as an R package
2. Building an image for said plumber API
3. Updating `plumber.yml` to include all APIs

This stack provides two simple plumber APIs to demonstrate the set up process.
